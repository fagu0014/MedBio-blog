    "text": "PIXI & CONTAINERS In the morning we had an introduction to pixi which is an environment used to acess a wanted environmennt or version of a program. we used it for preforming quality analysis of RNAseq data with fastqc and multiqc. commands learned mkdir - make directory (pre-tasks) pwd - to see where you are (pre-tasks) ls - list ln -s link data, making it visible without adding to a directory.\nAfter lunch we worked with containers.By creating or downloading a container i can use a tool in it. First we downloaded a container to run the fastqc analysis and later created our own container and run a tool to create a cow privding the date or a fortune.\ntake home for today for me was to be aware of different directory and paths and to dubble chech several times when the code is not running!"
