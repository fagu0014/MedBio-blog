Today was the first day of the course after a short introduction and coffe brake we had the first task. I learned how to collaborate using Git and Github, we all had to add our first and last name to a branch and then merge all stuents to finally have a list of all students in alfabetical order. Andter lunch we created our own blog using quarto and vscode!
